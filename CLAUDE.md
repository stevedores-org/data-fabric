## PR and Branch Workflow

- Base branch is always `develop`.
- Pull from remote frequently to avoid stale branches and merge drift.
- Open pull requests frequently in small increments.
- Keep pull requests atomic: one concern per PR, no mixed-scope changes.

## Notes

- Prefer SSH remotes when possible for Git operations.
